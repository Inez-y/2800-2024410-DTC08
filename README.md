## Usage Guide
- 1. What does the developer need to install (don’t leave anything out!) like:
    1. language(s)
    2. IDEs
    3. Database(s)
    4. Other software
2. Which 3rd party APIs and frameworks does the developer need to download?
3. Do they need any API keys?
4. In which order should they install things? Does installation location matter?
5. Include detailed configuration instructions.
6. Include a link to the testing plan you have completed so the new developer can see your testing history and maybe contribute to a minor bugfix!
7. ***In a separate plaintext file called passwords.txt that has NOT been added to your repo, provide us with any admin/user/server login IDs and passwords. Don’t add this to your repo, especially if your repo is public! Upload this plaintext file to the 05d Dropbox in D2L.***
